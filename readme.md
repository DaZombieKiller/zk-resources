ZK-Resources uses GDCC to compile its source code. GDCC is open-source software, its source code can be obtained at: [https://github.com/DavidPH/GDCC](https://github.com/DavidPH/GDCC)

#### How to use
1. Download the latest version of the Git repository [here](https://github.com/DaZombieKiller/zk-resources/archive/master.zip) or by cloning the repository with your favorite Git tool. This tutorial assumes you just downloaded the repo directly, rather than cloning it.
2. Extract the downloaded "zk-resources-master.zip" file to a folder somewhere.
3. Wherever you extracted the zip, there should be a folder called "zk-resources-master". Inside are all the files you will need.
4. Make a new folder inside the "zk-resources-master" folder called "GDCC" (if it doesn't exist already).
5. Download the latest version of GDCC from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e4msp35vxp61ztg/AAALcmttOua20tkcs82NoElWa). The latest version will always be at the bottom. Get either the "Win32" or "Win64" version depending on your computer.
NOTE: This has been tested with GDCC 0.12.0.
6. Extract the archive to the GDCC folder that you just created.
7. Now all you need to do is open "pk3_builder.bat" and follow the prompts.
